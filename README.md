# My-Radar – 2D Radar Simulation in C with CSFML

## Description

My-Radar is a simple 2D radar simulation developed in C using the CSFML library.  
The project focuses on rendering animated sprites, handling user input and events, and simulating moving targets on the radar display.

## Project Goals

- Use the CSFML library for rendering and input
- Create a graphical application with moving objects
- Handle event loops and timing
- Manage sprite animations and object collisions
- Structure a graphical C program

## Technologies Used

- Language: C
- CSFML (C Graphical library)
- Makefile

## Implemented Features

- Window creation and configuration
- Sprite loading and rendering
- Object movement and positioning
- User input handling
- Error handling

## Compilation

Before running, make sure CSFML is properly installed on your system:

make

## Usage

- ./my_radar -h (for usage parameters)
